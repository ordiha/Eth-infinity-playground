# Vision

**Eth-infinity-playground** is designed as an **infinite experimental lab** for Ethereum & Base.

## Goals
- Open interaction: anyone can join with any ETH amount.
- Simplicity: no complicated restrictions, free to use repeatedly.
- Variety: NFTs, tokens, games, experiments.
- Transparency: all contracts deployed, verified, and public.

## Long-Term Idea
To build a living archive of **community-driven smart contracts**, growing over time with new experiments and creative use cases.
